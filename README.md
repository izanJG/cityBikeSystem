  <h2>About this proyect ✨</h2>
  <h3>
    CityBikeSystem is a university project developed by a team of two people. This bicycle parking management system is my first project using object-oriented programming (OOP). 
    Although I am aware that there may be some bad practices due to my inexperience, I am proud of this achievement.

  <h2>Proyect description ⌨️​🖱️​</h2>
  <h3>
    CityBikeSystem manages bicycle stations organized by cities, which contain multiple parking points. These parking points are divided into anchors, which are the spaces where the bicycles are stored. 
    In addition, the system allows users to benefit from discounts depending on how many bicycles they are going to use or reserve, encouraging more efficient use of the service.
